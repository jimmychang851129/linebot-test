I believe I possess what it takes to work as an intern in Line Tech. Here are the reasons.

(1) Team Player
I am a great team player and have learned how to collaborate with others in a projects. I have worked on several projects and research with my classmates and have joined a team of 3 people in Trend Micro.
Generally, we run agile while developing the projects. We will places issues or tasks in github issues and have brief discussion two or three times a week to keep everyone in pace.
For examples, I have collaborated with members in the lab and have published two research papers. I also have worked with classmates on various of projects, and all of them are listed in the Github.

(2) English / presentation skills

I get 104 in TOEFL exams and have several overseas experience. I have presented my research in Holland and US, and I have joined overseas internship program as well as double degree program.
Based on lots of presentation experience, I believe I can precisely and concisely present my progress and idea.

(3) Extroverted and friendly

Though some people tend to perceive CS students as nerds. I am no where near a nerd, I have joined lots of extracurricular activities and have joined a lot of school clubs.
Therefore, I can get along with others and don't feel uncomfortable while interacting with others.
