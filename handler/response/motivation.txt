Followings are the Reason why I choose Line Tech Fresh.

1. Impacts
Line app is widely used in several Asian countries and is widely used in Taiwan for communication, and I am looking for a chance to work on things that can really have positive impacts on the soceity.
I believe joining Line internship program is one of the approach that I can really create useful things and make our society better.

2. Learning
Though I have several internship or research experience, I haven't really have a chance to work on a large projects. 
I believe that developing such a large projects may require knowledges that I have yet learned. Therefore, I would like to have a chance joining such kinds of projects and enhance my ability (either in programming or collbaroation).

3. Company Culture
As I am going to graduate in 2022, I hope to have the chance to work as an intern in my coveted companies. I would like to know more about the company's culture or how things work in industry.
