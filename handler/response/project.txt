The blog is a record of my life and learning notes.

Belows are the projects that I involved or took full responsible for.

1. CyberAutonomy
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hchsiao/pub/2019_WWW.pdf
This is the demonstration of our research works which was published in the Web Conference 2019. Generally, this websites demonstrate the security issues of government websites in many aspects.

2. VBA-Obfuscation Detector
https://github.com/jimmychang851129/VBA-Obfuscate-Detector
This is the tools for detecting obfuscation in vba scripts. We hope this can help the security specialist in identifying the obfuscation techniques used in the malicious vba code.

2. Harmonica to music sheet
https://github.com/jimmychang851129/DSP_2018Spring

I aim to convert the harmonica to music sheet automatically. This project attempts to take the audio files as input and output the music tones of the music.
We collect our own dataset and perform feature engineering and machine learning techniques to create a classifier. The classifier can classify the music into the corresponding music tone.

3. BlockChain Cert
https://certproof.nchc.org.tw/#/overview

This is the projects I involved when I was an intern in NCHC. We create a blockchain-based certificate system. 
We hope to automate the procedures for issuing the certificatie or diploma while maintaining high security level. 
Therefore, we take advantes of the mechanism in the blockchain (e.g. decentralized, immutable) to implement such system.

If you would like to find the menu (the flex message), simply type any words here. For example, "hello".
